# Quantum UI Theme for Atom

<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27056280/Screenshot%202015-01-18%2013.49.34.png" />

Quantum is a simple, flat theme for Atom based around the Tomorrow color scheme. **Pair it with the [Quantum Syntax Theme](https://github.com/mbullington/quantum-syntax)**.

Originally, somewhere under all this new CSS, Quantum originated and was forked from [neutron-ui](https://atom.io/themes/neutron-ui) by @brentd, which was forked from the Atom port of Spacegray. Oh, how nice open source software is.

## Notes:
  * Quantum works best with the Source Code Pro font. If you have it installed you can enable via Atom's settings by entering "Source Code Pro" into the Font Family field.
